# Develop

## Code of conduct

As a developer, my intention is to stick to the standards and follow the documentation of the tools in order to promote 
a quick start for a new person on the subject and to promote teamwork.

- favor atomic commit
- do not circumvent the operation of a tool without documenting it and especially without good reason.
- don't forget to remove links to private repositories

## Application architecture
